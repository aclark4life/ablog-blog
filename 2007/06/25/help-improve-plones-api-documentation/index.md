**Sponsor my trip to the Plone \"DocComm\" Sprint in California**

I\'m travelling from Washington, DC, USA to Mountain View, CA, USA June
26 - 29 to participate in the 2007 [Plone DocComm
Sprint](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/doc-and-e-commerce-sprint/project-home).
My main focus will be updating [Plone\'s online API
documentation](http://api.plone.org). If you are interested in seeing
this done and would like to help, please consider making a donation to
help offset the cost of my airfare. In return, I will create and upload
API documentation for:

-   **Plone-2.5.3**
-   **Archetypes-1.4.4**
-   **CMF-1.6.4**

and:

-   **Plone-3.0**
-   **Archetypes-1.5.0**
-   **CMF-2.1.0**

I plan to use either [Epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/) or
[Pudge](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pudge), suggestions welcome.
