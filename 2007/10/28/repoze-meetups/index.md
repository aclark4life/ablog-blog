**Plumbing Zope into the WSGI Pipeline**

As Paul Everitt
[recently](http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/2007/10/26.html#a440)
[mentioned](http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/2007/10/26.html#a441), the
[dudes](http://agendaless.com) are back. Three self-described graybeards
doing what they love: Zope. But this is not your father\'s Zope. This is
Repoze, which integrates Zope technologies with WSGI and reusable Python
middleware. [One of the dudes](http://plope.com) will be delivering the
first of a two part presentation on [Repoze](http://repoze.org) tonight
in DC. Next month, he\'ll be joined by [the other
dude](http://palladion.com) and possibly Paul Everitt himself.
