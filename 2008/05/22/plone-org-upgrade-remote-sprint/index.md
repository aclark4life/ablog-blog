Join us this Saturday in <irc://irc.freenode.net#PxC> at 4:00AM EDT to
work on Plone.org upgrade issues, including:

-   Deploying the latest PloneSoftwareCenter code to new.plone.org and
    testing
    [collective.dist](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.dist/0.1.9)
    against new.plone.org/products.
-   Develop and test collective.psc.mirroring. This is the
    PloneSoftwareCenter module responsible for copying uploads to
    dist.plone.org.
-   Develop and test
    [collective.psc.blobstorage](http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.psc.blobstorage)
    and
    [collective.psc.externalstorage](http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.psc.externalstorage/)
    and collective.psc.filestorage (which does not exist yet). These are
    the modules responsible for implementing pluggable storage in
    PloneSoftwareCenter.
