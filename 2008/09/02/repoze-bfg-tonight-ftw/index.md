**Tonight ex-Zope Corporation developer Chris McDonough unveils his
BFG**

From the [docs](http://static.repoze.org/bfgdocs/), BFG is:

-   is a **Python web application framework**.
-   is inspired by Zope's publisher, though it is less ambitious in
    scope.
-   relies heavily on Zope libraries and WSGI.
-   **Familiarity**: As web developers, we've become accustomed to
    working in very particular ways (primarily using Zope 2) over the
    years. This framework is a canonization of practices that "fit
    our brains".
