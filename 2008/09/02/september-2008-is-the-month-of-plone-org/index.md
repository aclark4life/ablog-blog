**Upgrade to Plone 3 before the conference**

[Plone Conference 2008](http://plone.org/2008) is fast approaching and
to avoid embarrassment, disappointment and public outcry I\'d like to
declare **September 2008 The Month Of Plone.org**. I have created an
OpenPlans project to help coordinate efforts:
