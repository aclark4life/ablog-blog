Lots of exciting things are happening with Plone.org!

1.  [Calvin Hendryx-Parker](http://twitter.com/calvinhp) and [Six Feet
    Up](http://sixfeetup.com) are working on moving \*.plone.org to one
    of their powerful new servers (with some exceptions, most notably
    {svn,dev}.plone.org will remain in place, as I understand it)!
2.  [Alex Limi](http://limi.net) and
    [company](http://plone.org/team/WebsiteTeam) are working on
    deploying a new look and feel using a new-fangled technology called
    xdv (a variant of Deliverance).
3.  I am removing [kinks](https://dev.plone.org/plone.org/ticket/1080)
    that have been lingering after the recent upgrade (in theory ;-).

This blog entry is both a \"call to arms\" to everyone involved in
helping, and a message to everyone waiting patiently that we haven\'t
forgotten about you! :-D

In particular, I\'d like to hear from any early adopters of the new
<http://plone.org/products>section. You can read about how to use the
new PyPI functionality here, if you haven\'t already:
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.dist/0.2.2>. In my little
\"test\" product, I found it quite useful:
[http://plone.org/products/Products.todo/.](http://plone.org/products/Products.todo/)

So if you are using it, I\'d definitely like to hear your experiences.
Or if not, please give it a try!
