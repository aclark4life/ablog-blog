**Tarek\'s new thing**

## What's the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2009?

That would be [Zenoss](http://zenoss.org). I\'m very impressed with the
application as well as the community, which is awesome. They remind me a
lot of the Plone community; I think the two can learn a lot from each
other.

## What new programming technique did you learn in 2009?

Generally speaking, I\'m happy with my progress as a Plone integrator,
plowing through the tremendous Plone code stack, on my way to complete
mastery. I may never get there, but I\'m having fun trying. In other
words, I know a lot more about how far the Zope2/CMF/Five rabbit hole
goes. If I had to pick, I\'d choose Grok in Plone, mostly as it relates
to Dexterity:
<http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/five.grok>. I
created <http://plone.org/products/collective-project> as a result, or
rather, I converted the package to use Dexterity types so I could learn
Dexterity, in part ;-). At first I was angry at being \"forced\" to use
Grok techniques in Plone, but then it grew on me.

## What's the name of the open source project you contributed the most in 2009? What did you do?

[Plone](http://plone.org).

-   I dug out from [Plone Conference
    2008](http://plone.org/events/conferences/2008-washington-dc), which
    included publishing the [videos and
    slides](http://plone.org/events/conferences/2008-washington-dc/agenda).
-   I helped move plone.org to [Six Feet Up](http://sixfeetup.com), and
    have been looking after
    [it](http://dev.plone.org/plone/browser/Products.PloneOrg/trunk) as
    well as [other infrastructure
    issues](http://plone.org/news/plone-domain-dns-changes).
-   I worked on a book called \'Plone Site Admin\', which will most
    likely come out in early 2010 (via [Packt](http://packtpub.com)). I
    hope the community will find it useful.
-   I contributed a [new
    feature](http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9330) to Plone 4.

## What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2009?

[Planet Plone](http://planet.plone.org).

## What are the three top things you want to learn in 2010?

-   [Zenoss](http://zenoss.org)
-   [WSGI](http://wsgi.org/wsgi/)
-   [Plone 4 core
    development](http://dev.plone.org/plone/browser/buildouts/plone-coredev/branches/4.0)

Happy (Python) New Year everyone!
