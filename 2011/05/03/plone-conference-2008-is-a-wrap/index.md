**I have yet to finish my obligations to Plone Conference 2008 until
NOW.**

I have yet to finish my obligations to [Plone Conference
2008](http://plone.org/2008) until NOW: approximately 2 years, 6 months,
and 23 days after the end of the post-conference sprint.

## The story

We had some trouble with the video company and I had to hunt them down
to get copies of missing talks. We still didn\'t get everything, but
this is the last of what we did get. I got these missing DVDs about a
year ago, and since then I\'ve been trying to find the time to upload
them to [blip.tv](http://zpugdc.blip.tv/). Invariably, I got stuck on
some aspect of the conversion process so I decided to \"give up\" and
just upload the ripped copies to
[dist.plone.org](http://dist.plone.org:5021/media/video/conference/2008/PloneConference2008/).

As such, if anyone in the community has the time and expertise to
convert these to Quicktime format, I would greatly appreciate it, and I
would be happy to upload the results to blip.tv (this is how we did it
the first time if I recall correctly.) Until then, they have at least
reached their final resting place, and folks can get access to them if
they are interested, here:

Remarkably, some of these newly added videos are *still* relevant
**and** enjoyable to watch, as are many of the ones already available in
the easily browsable
[archive](http://plone.org/events/conferences/2008-washington-dc/agenda).

My sincerest apologies to the community and especially to those whose
videos were amongst this group for the delay, you should not have had to
wait 2 days let alone over 2 years!

Thus, I now declare [Plone Conference 2008](http://plone.org/2008) to be
wrapped. Thanks to Sean Kelly for the [help transferring the
video](http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11762) to plone.org.
