**The website for Python egoistsâ„¢**

I have this overwhelming desire to know how many times my favorite
Python packages have been downloaded. Don\'t you? If so, look no further
than [pythonpackages.com](http://pythonpackages.com).

## Count downloads

Where you can enter a package like
[Django](http://pythonpackages.com/info/django) and find out the number
of downloads.

## Count favorites

Or click on **Count favorites** to reveal how many times it has been
favorited.

## Find trash

Or even poke some good natured fun at it, for its [failure to provide
adequate package metadata](http://pythonpackages.com/trash/django).

## Discuss packages

You can even *discuss*packages on
[pythonpackages.com](http://pythonpackages.com).

## Recent activity

But wait there is more! You can also browse the [latest changelog
activity](http://pythonpackages.com/pypi) from PyPi right on the site.

## Package info

Lastly, if you get bored counting package downloads and favorites you
can look at the *actual* [package
metadata](http://pythonpackages.com/info/django).

## Conclusion

Sound interesting? Or utterly silly, perhaps? I think
[pythonpackages.com](http://pythonpackages.com) is the best of both. It
started off as a front end to the command line utility
[vanity](http://pythonpackages.com/info/vanity), but has taken on a life
of it\'s own.

After a small run on Python reddit and Hacker News, I\'m looking forward
to seeing what Python Planet folks think. So please check out
[pythonpackages.com](http://pythonpackages.com) and let me know. You can
leave comments about the site here.
