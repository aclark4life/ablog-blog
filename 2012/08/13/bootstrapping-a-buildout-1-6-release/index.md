# Bootstrapping a Buildout 1-6 release

**A lot of work has been done on Buildout lately.**

Most notably:

-   Jim Fulton is [working on Buildout
    2](https://github.com/buildout/buildout/commits/master).
-   Ross Patterson has greatly [improved Buildout
    performance](http://rpatterson.net/blog/buildout-performance-improvements).
-   Domen KoÅ¾ar has [provided a
    patch](http://zope3.pov.lt/trac/changeset/127507) that takes a
    conservative approach to Ross\'s performance improvements.
-   I have offered to do a release.

And there are a [handful of other
changes](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2012-July/018779.html)
in [trunk on
svn.zope.org](http://zope3.pov.lt/trac/browser/zc.buildout/trunk/CHANGES.txt?rev=127507#L4),
of which my favorite is:

> The buildout init command now accepts distribution requirements and
> paths to set up a custom interpreter part that has the distributions
> or parts in the path. For example:: \$ python bootstrap.py init
> BeautifulSoup

So with that, I am **planning to do a zc.buildout 1.6 release within 24
hours** or so of now. Please add a comment or weigh in on
[distutils-sig](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig)
if you object. We have run the tests on Windows, and discovered only
pre-existing failures. We are also preparing to do \"Buildout 2
prophylactic releases\" (i.e. releases that make 1.x continue to work
when 2.x is released) in the 1.6.x series.
