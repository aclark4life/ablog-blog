**For anyone new to my blog, welcome.**

## Who

For anyone new to my blog, welcome. I am Alex Clark: Python Web
Developer.

## What

Recently with a tweet, I announced the start of a new personal project:

## When

I have tentatively scheduled this project to be completed by the end of
2013, because it\'s important to set a deadline.

## Where

This project will be hosted on one of my current favorite websites:
<http://readthedocs.org>.

## Why

I think about Plone a lot as it relates to my current professional work.
And I have more thoughts than I can currently keep track of in blogs,
tweets, etc. So I decided to make an effort to write them all down.

## How

I think a lot about what other people think about Plone, so I decided
this book will feature comments from the general public in it. E.g.:

## How much?

This book will be free. But if you\'d like to support its development,
please [gittip me](http://gittip.com/aclark4life).

There\'s not much to it yet, but feel free to head over and add some
comments: <https://plone-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>.
