# Pillow Runs Itself

**As of Pillow 2.6.0, the Pillow project almost completely runs
itself!**

Of course when I say \"runs itself\" I mean \"runs without me\", which
is what **every open source project lead hopes for**. For the first time
ever, I was able to:

-   Turn off GitHub Watching until two weeks before the release.
-   Not run [setup.py upload]{.title-ref} or [twine upload]{.title-ref}
    myself.
-   Watch in awe as Pillow Men #s 2 & 3 did all the work. \[1\]

Kudos to these gentlemen for making my life easier and for continuing to
provide the Python community with a featureful, modern & secure Python
Imaging Library. Additionally **thanks to all the contributors from all
over the world** who continue to develop and improve Pillow. I used to
keep a list, but now there are [too many to keep track
of](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/graphs/contributors). Oh and
lastly, [2.6.0 is
out](https://twitter.com/wiredfool/status/517382632267841536)! Enjoy the
release & please [report issues

P.S. New theme! Thanks [Pure Pelican Theme](http://purepelican.com/).
