**Blog functionality for Sphinx**

After years of using Pelican for blogging and Sphinx for everything
else, I became annoyed that Pelican\'s [File metadata
format](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html#file-metadata)
did not match Sphinx\'s
[directives](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html#directives).
Around the same time, I noticed that
[ABlog](http://ablog.readthedocs.org/) had matured enough to be usable.

So late last year I began converting all my Pelican metadata to Sphinx
directives, and did quite a bit of clean up as well. I\'m finally
finished, and now ready to present the results (**ta-da**). Thank you
Pelican for all the years of service, and thank you ABlog for helping me
use Sphinx for blogging!
